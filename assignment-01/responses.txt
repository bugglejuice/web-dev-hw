1. I took this class previously 
and failed to complete the final 
and therefore failing but I enjoyed 
it so I don't mind retaking it.

2. I hope to learn better coding practices 
to speed up the site-making process.

3.The photo submitted is a self portrait that
I painted digitally using a freeware program 
called krita it took roughly 8 hours and is heavily
stylized.
