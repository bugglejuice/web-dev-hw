            <h3>About this Page</h3>
            <p>I wrote this page because 3D modeling is something that has interested
                me for a long time, I've used to it create game assets, make short 
                animations, to create a 3D printable file, and to create static artwork.
                I think it's a wonderful outlet for creativity and below you will see a 
                couple of pieces that I have done recently. If you enjoyed my tutorial, 
                search "blender tutorial" on youtube and dive in. I recomment starting 
                with the Doughnut tutorial. It gives you a good grasp of the basics.
