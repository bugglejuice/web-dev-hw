            <p><b>Here at RoboFungus</b> we strive to provide a quality product 
                regardless of what it is. We've been doing static digital 
                paintings right alongside traditional art. We've also been working 
                on making games for a few years now and we hope to have some news 
                out soon. In the meantime, Below are a few pieces that have come 
                out of the studio in the last year to really show how diverse our 
                portfolio is. Another venture on the rise is high-end cosplay with 
                fully operational portable animatronics for cosyplay and theatre. 
                Once we have something other than a drawing board to show for it 
                we'll be sure to get the word out but in the meantime, please 
                enjoy the art we've dug out of the virtual pile.</p>
