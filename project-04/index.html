            <p><b>WELCOME</b> to the humble home of RoboFungus. We are a 
                multimedium studio who work on digital paintings, intricate 
                animatronic cosplay, and our pride, joy and labor of love, 
                video games. We are attempting to shift gears and become a 
                full blown game development studio. We can't disclose any 
                of our projects at the moment but we are gearing up to 
                start a podcast and a youtube channel where we plan to 
                update weekly on all of our ongoing projects. So stay 
                tuned for that!</p>
                
            <p><b>You may have noticed</b> the little guy on top of the 
                page. That's our logo and mascot, Fergus the fungus 
                crusader. It's a bit of a funny story how he came to be 
                actually, While making this site, delerious from lack of 
                sleep, I knew what I wanted the Logo to look like and I 
                drew him in about 20 minutes. Oh the things you can do 
                when exhausted.</p>
                
            <p><b>I guess</b> some introductions are in order. My name is 
                Zack Leach, I am 29, live in great falls and I work at BNSF 
                as a freight train conductor when I'm not working on making 
                this venture as great as I know it can be. Before all that 
                I spent 6 years in the U.S. Navy where I was stationed in 
                San diego for about 4 years. I went on 2 deployments and saw 
                most of the world. After that was done I came home to montana. 
                It's a life and it's one I'm grateful to have had. But enough 
                about me, there's a whole beautiful website for you to enjoy!
                Please feel free to look around and don't hesitate to reach out! 
                I'm too stubborn for this startup to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
